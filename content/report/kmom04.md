The allmighty Colors
=======================
<div class="kmom4">


In this report I will try to describe or say my point of view of the colors and typography on three different websites. I am going to analyze and compare my own perception of the website's feeling, versus the one I think the creators wanted to convey. Fun!

<h1>Urval</h1>


I have choosed the site 'pinterest.com' because I spend a lot of time on Pinterest searching for clothes, recipes and so one. My second pick is car dealership 'kamux.se', from the same reason so spending a lot of time there and the site is really ok for me. The third site is my student page <a href="http://www.student.bth.se/~beha20/dbwebb-kurser/design/me">Student.Bth</a> because I want to tell more about it, and that is a page which I really know all about it so why not to analyise it.

<h1>Metod</h1>


I used methods such as ColorZilla, one really advanced tool which helped me to get exact color of any pixel on the page. Then with the help of the Chromium's development tool, I was able to find out the website's choice of font and i used the tool LightShot to take a customizable screenshots. And when we speak about the tools one really good was a picture which shows differences between sans-serif and serif <a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/sans.jpg">Sans-serif VS Serif..</a>.




<h1>Resultat<h1>



<h3>Pinterest</h3>
<li><a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/pinterest.jpg">ScreenShot..</a></li>

Colors:

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #E60023">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #EFEFEF">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #111111">
</tr>
</table>

Pinterest use four different kind of colors, boring colors but they do the job especially when we know that is a social site whose content is made mostly out of pictures. Their main color that represents them is a pure red even there is not much of red on the site. Maybe we can also say that their accent color is also red and you can find it as hover when you point a picture. A triadic color scheme is being used on this site and Suomi Sans-serif Font.

<h3>Kamux</h3>
<li><a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/kamux.jpg">ScreenShot..</a></li>

Colors:

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #BFD600">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #000000">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #ED8E22">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FDF151">
</tr>
</table>

Kamux use five or even more kind of different colors. Same as prevoius site Kamux is also main content are pictures. 
Their main color is green, we can say that's the color which represent them the most. 
I would said that their accent color is yellow, because if we see that they choosed yellow to point out the price of the vehicles they sell it could be something that's draw attention to key pieces of a web page. Analogus color scheme is being use along with black, white and grey. The used font is Helvetica Sans-serif.


<p><h3>Min Portfolio</h3></p>
<li><a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/screenshot.jpg">ScreenShot..</a></li> 

Colors:

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #8D8D8D">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #000000">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #BD262C">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #ECA934">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
</tr>
</table>

As I said third page is my student page and I used mostly black and grey color with accent color red which is my main color on my page. Red is one of the top two favorite colors of all people,
and it is used more then any other on flags in the world (approximately 77% of all flags include red)[3]. Maybe is the best example my own page and my own colors I used on this page. I'm not sure that I did a good job so maybe after this you can give me some pointers. There is also a bit of goldish color around pictures with the white Roboto sans-serif font which is good balance between black background and the white font. I tried to follow the picture's look and to build design led by the colors on the picture in the navbar.




<p><h1>Analys</h1></p>




<h3>Kamux</h3>
The Kamux dealrship did a very good job we the analogous color scheme, now when I see from the other point of view I could say that's a monochromatic[1] color scheme because it's been used different variations of color green but anologus color scheme is the right answer[2]. Different various of green which if we take a deeper look of the color green which stands for GROWTH and HEALTH. Green color evokes feeeling of abundance providing restful and secure feeling. They aimed that costumers feel comfortable providing refreshing and peaceful site, which should induce them to buy and that they are right place to make a purchase.



<p><h3>Pinterest</h3></p>
I'm not realy the best person to make design analyse but I would try. Pinterest usage of colors is limited, white colors prevails and accent color red is visible in just small corner of the picture hover and on the pages logo. With the choice of white as the background color, I think that Pinterest wanted to put the greatest focus on what the whole page is based on, the content itself. As one (beside Facebook, Instagram or Twitter) of the biggest social media, and already established giant on the internet and thus it is not difficult to assume that they do not have a great need to have a clear identity on the site or some complicated and advanced page.The font Suomi Sans-serif Font selection can continue to build on the principle I have mentioned earlier, about that the content is in focus. The font is simple and blends easily into the background. The choice of font may have been a missed opportunity for a clearer identity, but as previously mentioned, it is probably not something it has a great need for.



<p><h3>Min sida</h3></p>
From the other side I used well known fundamental design principle KISS(keep it simple stupid)[4]. Black and grey with the big mural picture in the navbar which is the beginning and the ground the whole design. My page is all about footbal team from my hometown and among the players on the picture is my dad, he was a big footbal player of his time and I'm very proud of him. So I used black and red which is the colors of the <a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/dres.jpg">jersey</a>. I think I kept it simple, maybe too dark but as I said i tried to follow the concept.
