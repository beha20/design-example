Page speed Analysis
==================


<p>In this kurs moment I´m going to learn and write more about what the Page Speed is and hove to improve it. Page speed is a measurement of how fast the content on your page loads. A website can be measured and evaluated on a scale from 1 to 100, with 100 being the best possible result.</p>

<h1>Urval</h1>

In this project I have choosed three different wineries. The first one is italian king of wines Amarone and winery <a href="https://www.brunelliwine.com/en/">Brunelli</a>, then I chose Bosnian winery <a href="https://podrumivukoje1982.com/">Vukoje</a> with the sort Vranac and the third one is a spanish winery <a href="https://www.riojalta.com/en/wines_rioja-alta/">La Rijoa Alta, S.A.</a> with the most popular sort Tempranillo. <p>The reason why is more than obvious, I like wines and I can say that I understand something about wines (or at least I have the desire and will to read and of course sometimes drink one) or two.</p>


<h1>Metod</h1>

I chose these three wineries because they are more or less my favorites and I think that the most concrete results would be obtained by comparing similar ones.Tools I used are <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a> and with the help of Google Devtools. I mesaured every page three times to get more accurate result.<p> With the help of PageSpeed tool and Google Devtool which records the result in range as 0-49 is low, 50-89 is medium and 90-100 is high. As I said I mesaured pages three times (Desktop speedIndex) and all results are saved in this <h1> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pZ13pD0OCWXrRzTKYw6CnP0Ejg6y8xZm1TDCLo_il64/edit?usp=sharing">Excel Sheet</a> </h1>


<h1>Resultat</h1>


Winery Brunelli
<li><a class="screenshots" href="brunelli.png">ScreenShot..</a></li>

Winery Brunelli is really among those who can say that they have above the average using Page Speed. With the medium in mobile version and very close to high in desktop version on the home page, while on other two desktop pages have enviably good high result. Page starts with PageSpeed ​​Insights at 55 out of 100 on mobile phones with desktop startup 87. We get average spedd of 1.59333 seconds with 118 requests for 6.3 MB size on the home page. Links to the mesaured pages are: <a href="https://www.brunelliwine.com/en/our-wines/wines/amarone-della-valpolicella/">Home page</a>, <a href="https://www.brunelliwine.com/en/our-wines/">2nd Page</a> and the <a href="https://www.brunelliwine.com/en/our-wines/wines/amarone-della-valpolicella/">3rd Page</a>.

On these pages we get average speed of 2.0666666 seconds with 96 requests for 7.1 MB in total size of the home page.

<h1>Analys</h1>

<p>Globally looked att all three of the mesaured sites, we can say that they all have a good loading speed, we almost all 9 mesaured pages keeps average loadig ratings under two second(with exceptions in 2nd Vukoje page which is all three times showed deep over 2 seconds) and La Rioja Alta home page where it was a bit slower than it was in the rest of the mesaured pages for the La Rioja Alta.</p>

<p>They all showed a space to make some improvement also, where it could be even better than it is right now. I, as a experienced design expert can suggest to them even I´m not shure they will listen to me but they could improve the loading page with just few 'tricks'. So all three have little unremoved unused Javascript(could help if they remove it), then Vukoje have also some issues with rendering the page and could make some improves there.</p>

<p>What I can coclude that Winery Brunelli in my eyes is winner, they have a really good loading speed(better than both of the pages mesaured in both segments mobile and desktop version). But they all have pretty good and good working with small differeces which can see just we experienced design experts.</p>
