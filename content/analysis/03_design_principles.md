Design principles
==================

<p>This report is about evaluating three different website design principles.</p>

<h1>Urval</h1>

In this project I have choosed webb sites of the restaurants here in Karlskrona and of course my portfolio:<p><li> <a href="https://www.montmartre.se/">Montmartre</a></p><p><li><a href="https://www.niva.nu/">Nivå</a></p><p><li><a href="http://antonios.se/">Antonio´s</a></p><li><a href="http://www.student.bth.se/~beha20/dbwebb-kurser/design/me">http://www.student.bth.se/~beha20/dbwebb-kurser/design/me/portfolio</a></li>


<h1>Metod</h1>

Restaurant and wine are my kind of passion so why not to continue to analysis juste that.I have mainly started from the design principles which are nicely visualized on <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> and throw devtools <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">ligthouse</a>.


<h1>Resultat</h1>

Restaurant Montmartre
<li><a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/montmartre.jpg">ScreenShot..</a></li>

<p>Website objectives and purpose is really important for one site, and we can see by scrolling down the page many pictures of the restaurant and the food which is the main point of the every restaurant. There are also general information, opening and closing times and even quotes from the satisfied guests. So the main goal of the website is to attract new and keep them well informed along with old regular guests.</p>

<p>Is it successful, or does the design benefit the site's goals and purpose?
In my opinion, they have managed to create a nice but not too stylish design. This means that visitors can easily link the website and to see all needed information and that's it!</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, they have used slightly narrow fonts that are not in sufficient contrast to the background colors, which can make some text difficult to read. Many elements are arranged in nice symmetrical rows or boxes, which creates balance and clarity. I think they have managed to create contrast between images, animations and backgrounds, but as I said, the typography is sometimes a bit unreadable due to text thickness, but also in colors that are not in sufficient contrast to the background. </p>

<p>Using tools we have managed to learn in this kmom06, 'lighthouse' shows us a pretty low-medium accessibility which is at 64 out of 100 and performance is also on the 70.</p>

<br>Restaurant Nivå<br>
<li><a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/nivå.jpg">ScreenShot..</a></li>

<p>Website objectives and purpose are kind of the same as a previous one, so to inform and to attract more guest and to show their restaurant as one of the best in town. The whole design is made aiming to deliver information as well as large pictures of the restaurant covering the entire page.</p>

<p>Does the design benefit the site's goals and purpose, is really a good question.
The interesting thing about the design of this website is that it stands what they trying to achieve, what really they stand for and that is to buy local stuff. If you scroll down, you can see that they follow a clear pattern where rows are kept a little narrower in width than pictures, which instead cover almost the entire page. This creates a rhythm and is repeated, which makes the design feel consistent and interesting. Grids in various forms are also widely used. </p> 
<p>The website basically uses colors from the picture made of restaurants interior (according to pictures old style) is very gray and minimalist but the restaurant itself is everything but not minimalist and grey. However, I think that with this website they manage to arouse interest with the help of the challenging design.</p>

<p>Home page according to the 'lighthouse' showing very low performance astonishing 19 out of 100 and accessibilty at 82.</p>



<br>Restaurant Antonio's<br>
<li><a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/antonios.jpg">ScreenShot..</a></li>

<p>Website objectives and purpose is the same I wanted to compare the simliar ones. The layout is very minimalist, and they use a wide white color as a background which makes focus on to creating a stylish and traditional presentation their restaurant, which is kind of italian traditional style.</p>

<p>Does the design benefit the site's goals and purpose?
I think that this site definitely manages to visualize the simplicity of the traditonal restaurant with the more less minimalistic design. As a different with previous two sites, they have managed to have a good typography very easy to read with good text thickness and sufficient contrast to the background.</p>

<p>So this page also have checked throw devtools 'lighthouse' and it shows a bit better result when comparing with two previous one accessibilty is at 81 while performance is on 69.</p>


<br>Portfolio<br>
<li><a class="screenshots" href="../assets/img/screen.jpg">ScreenShot..</a></li>

<p> Website objectives and purpose is this project was for me to learn more (which wasn't too hard, because I didn't have a clue) about web design. First I followed the design of the mural picture on the site which I used as ground for whole pages design, and I have built all the design around that picture. After teachers advise to try something new with colors, turned all upside down and played a little bit more with colors(nothing to crazy but a change). White as a container background with the black typography which lead to a great contrast. I think thickness of the font is pretty good, nothing to advance but it loooks nice and do the job for if you ask me. For one beginner and his first ever site I think it is a succesful page.</p>
<p>I think i did a very good job with the underpages 'Report', 'Gallery' and 'Analysis' they all are pefrectlysymmetrical with the help of the grids. White background makes easier to read the content, and color usage is not to wide which create nice contrast. Unlike the other three analyzed sites mine site stand very high sccording the devTools and 'lighthouse', 98 for perfomance and 100 for accessibilty.</p>
