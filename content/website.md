<strong>Colors</strong>
<p>Chosing colors felt very difficult at first, then I realized that I have a customer which exaggerates in everything (that’s all his text says) so wanted to follow kitschie syle of his. In the headers I have a big bluish picture with the clouds and it a person who I wanted to present direct when you are on his site. To make a contrast big yellow title above him says who he is, and the body background is gold,black and brown which in my thinking really represent tis client. Footer are black and white, with the clickable links in yellow.</p>

<strong>Tema</strong>
<br>

<p>I chose to make a website for “Art Ist” which I see as one of the young up-and-coming stars in the RnB. I used one my portfolio themes as a basis for the customer I created now. So, I had a certain structure that I could work on from now one.
The first thing that users encounter on the first page is a large golden vinyl, which gives a depth directly on page loading. 
The customer's goal with the website is to get more members to the association, but also to arouse interest in young RnB upcoming stars.</p>
<p>Since my interpretation of the customer's wishes was that it would arouse interest, I immediately thought that I wanted lot of customers picture and put his character in the focus.</p>
<p>As a background color I used flash-picture of a lot of vinyl which I think it fit perfectly with the "music design" I tried to create.I think I have managed to create contrast between images, animations and backgrounds, maybe the typography is sometimes a bit unreadable due to text thickness, but also in colors that are not in sufficient contrast to the background(in case with links to the songs).</p>
<p>I choosed font in headers and headings that would arouse interest. I think I accomplished that with the "blue sky" which goes hand in hand with vivid and kitsch style I wanted to create. What I have used is called "Josefin Sans" and I think that font puts a good focus and makes the design a little more vivid and not as flat. In addition, I tried to use the information I learned in the analysis with modern web pages to make my own theme look modern. Minimalist when it comes to colors and elements hierarchies are also very clear in the typography, where headings are much larger than body text as well as clear repetition of elements.
Since I have a fairly strong text on headings, I wanted a simpler and easier to read font for the rest of the website and thought it fit well, that is why 'content' in a nice clear way setup.</p>

<strong>Feelings</strong>

<p>Blue sky on a headers makes site interesting direct, and follow the path of ideas about vivid and joyfull site. The picture and the name make it very clear that it is a artist page. What I have tried to create is 100% "kitsch" with lot of golden records, a lot of pictures of artist creates that we are on website one young upcoming star(who doesn´t have too much money to pay some good designer to do the job).</p>

<strong>SASS</strong>

<p>I chose to have the almost same structure in the sass code as in the portfolio. So the structure is the same as we have recommended earlier in courses. I update package.json for a new theme and adjust the twig file to use my version of the css file. It was easier to do like his because then I would have more complicated things to do, because in my version npm run keeps track of my style.</p>
