Something about me
==========================

Hi,

My name is Benaris Hajduk and I´m 33 years old and I´m from Bosnia and Hercegovina living here in Sweden for almost 4 years.
I was born in a city Zenica in Bosnia and Hercegovina. Of course for me this is most beautifull city in the world(like it is for everybody his/hers home town)
<p>I´m married and have two wonderful kids. Daughter Leali is 5 years old, and son 3 years old.</p> 

Student at BTH, because they have a great structure, I chose 'Web programming'. I have always had a great interest in the web, programming and data.
We as a familiy moved to Sweden in August 2016, because we like challenges and like to solve problems (if you can joke a little).
<p>I have always had a great interest in the web, programming and data. Then I ended up in your program.</p>
My hobbies, maybe can say that I am a real wine lover, not quite sure that it is a hobby,
but to me it is even more because I worked as a waiter, somelier and bar manager. Likes football, tennis and of course coding and programming.
